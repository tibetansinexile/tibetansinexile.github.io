Chinese garrison and when we left we didn’t know if we would see the next day. It wasn’t until we
reached the top of the Che-la pass that we began to feel out of immediate danger. Local people had
brought us horses. We mounted them and then turned to take one last look at Lhasa. Then we left.”</h2>

											<h3>Tsenjol - Forced into Exile</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Following the forced escape of His Holiness the Dalai Lama in March 1959, thousands of Tibetans
also fled Tibet, and it was these refugees who formed the early exile community. The refugee
community now stands at around 130,000 spread across numerous settlements in India, Nepal and
Bhutan, with thousands more displaced around the world. Tibetans are often referred to as the world’s
most successful refugee community, but the story of how they first came into exile and survived is
sometimes forgotten in the annals of history.</p>
<p>This photo journal attempts to highlight the profound challenges and considerable efforts undertaken
under the leadership of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, then aged 23, and the first generation of Tibetan
refugees who worked tirelessly with limited resources to establish the community in exile. The invasion
and occupation of Tibet in 1959 led to the widespread destruction and loss of Tibetan language,
culture, and religion. During the Cultural Revolution from 1966 - 1976, more than 6,000 monasteries
were destroyed. Even now, there are severe restrictions placed on all aspects of life for Tibetans living
under the Chinese regime.</p>
<p>For over half a century, the exile community has taken on the critical responsibility of protecting
and preserving Tibetan identity, culture, language and religion. Over a hundred monasteries in exile
provide religious learning for more than 10,000 monks and nuns, and more than a hundred schools
educate and look after thousands of exile children. The community has also successfully established
many cultural, religious and academic institutions of higher learning including libraries, research
institutes, performing arts and fine art centres, and uniquely dedicated establishments such as the
Tibetan Astrological and Medical Institute.</p>
