								<span class="cd-date"><strong>24 April, 1959<br/><p>“The mere fact of Dalai Lama living in India has some consequence
to India, to Tibet, to China and to the rest of the world. In China
it is immediately one of irritation and suspicion. Dalai Lama
being in India, keeps alive the question of Tibet in the minds
of the world. Tibet, as it were, cannot close up without news. It
becomes a difficult thing to manage. The tendency of the Chinese
authorities would be to crush Tibet as soon as possible. Nobody
can help. I cannot understand how the Khampas can resist
overwhelming Chinese force? One should, therefore, not close the
doors of settlement; otherwise, it becomes a fight to the death.”
